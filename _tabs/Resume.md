## üßë‚Äçüíº About Me 


I am Anurag Sharma, a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in **computer science, psychology, and artificial intelligence**. With experience in **human-computer interaction, NLP, cognitive science, and AI-driven automation**, I constantly seek to bridge the gap between **technology and human cognition**.  

Currently, I work at **OpenNLP Labs**, where I focus on cutting-edge AI solutions. My previous experience includes working as an **International Research Assistant at CMU** and contributing as an **Undergraduate Research Assistant in neonatology at RML Hospital**, reflecting my interdisciplinary approach to problem-solving.  

My technical expertise spans multiple domains, including:  
‚úÖ **AI & NLP** ‚Äì Building intelligent agents for voice, text, and sign language processing  
‚úÖ **Software Development** ‚Äì Creating scalable applications using Python, Dart, and other modern technologies  
‚úÖ **Automation & RPA** ‚Äì Streamlining workflows for KPI generation, reporting, and AI-based automation  
‚úÖ **Human-Computer Interaction** ‚Äì Designing user-centric experiences that integrate psychology and AI  

Beyond my work, I am deeply committed to **mentorship and community building**, actively engaging with students through GDG initiatives and teaching. My mission is to **enhance accessibility, learning, and engagement through AI-driven solutions** while fostering the next generation of technologists.
